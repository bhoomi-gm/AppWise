# Appstore_googleplay_project
The project gives an analysis of the google play app store data using python and tableau for visualization

In this growing era of technology mobile applications have become an integral part of daily life to many users. In this project we are going to do a comprehensive analysis of the android app market by comparing different types of apps in google play across different categories.
Analysing the mobile app download data provides valuable insights into market behaviour, this study examines the patterns and trends across various categories by identifying the key features which influence the popularity and success of apps.
Additionally, the study also highlights the impact of app downloads and marketing campaign on download rates.
The data being used for this project was obtained from an online website known as Kaggle.
The software which we are going to use is python (programming language) to get insights on the various types of data. We are going to use the different inbuilt libraries available in python, such as pandas and NumPy to analyse and get different insights from the available data.
These insights can be helpful to guide developers and businesses in optimizing their app utility and enhancing user engagement.
